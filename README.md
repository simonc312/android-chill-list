Hi, this is my take on the Todo list app. 

This app is not intended to be used for micro-managing your life, 
but instead to give you peace of mind through chilling.  

There are a few minor differences: 

- Create new todo in a DialogFragment 
- Open DialogFragment by clicking on FAB
- Todo items have a 150 character limit
- Delete todos by checking them off and pressing the big white checkmark in the corner.
- Todos are persisted with help of DBFlow version 2.2.1 library
